# A4: Call undo on an unmodified file
# EXPECTATION: Calling undo() without writing anything or on an empty file should not raise ay errors. 

# If the testfile exists, remove it from the directory
if "testfile.txt" in listfiles():
    removefile("testfile.txt")

# Open a testfile
myfile = openfile("testfile.txt", True)

# Call undo on the empty file. Expectation is, nothing should happen:
myfile.undo()  # Nothing to undo

# Close the file
myfile.close()
