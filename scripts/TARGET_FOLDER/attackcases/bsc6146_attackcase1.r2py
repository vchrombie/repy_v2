# Some files output just when run

# Never raise unexpected errors or produce any output.
# Confirm if unexpected output from the programs we are testing
# against is allowed since there may be bugs and unexpected behaviour.

# Create a directory that the security layers will write their files into.
# Is it ok to just write files into the current directory?
