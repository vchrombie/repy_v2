# A3: Two Undo() functions cannot be invoked simultaneously
# EXPECTATION: Invoking undo for a second time or beyond should not work. Only the first undo is permiited.
# This means, if x and y are written to the file sequentially, and two undos are invoked continuously, then x will still remain in the file.

# If the testfile exists, remove it from the directory
if "testfile.txt" in listfiles():
    removefile("testfile.txt")

# Open a testfile
myfile=openfile("testfile.txt",True)

# First write to the file 
myfile.writeat("12345678",0)

# Second write to the file 
myfile.writeat("Hi!",0) 

# First undo on the file 
myfile.undo()

# Second undo on the file - should not do anything. Only one Undo is permitted
myfile.undo()

# If the text entered first is still what is being read, then it is right. Otherwise, it is incorrect
assert("12345678" == myfile.readat(8,0))
# If the assertion fails, the multiple undo invocations indicate an unexpected behaviour. Note that only one undo() is allowed.
# Hence, if any error messages are logged to the console, the assertion condition has failed.

# Close the file
myfile.close()
